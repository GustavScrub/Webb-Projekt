        Fawfuls normal form looks like the image above. He is one of if not the biggest threat that the mushroom kingdom has ever seen.
        In his normal form that he has throughout most of the games he shows that he is a tech genius. 4 examples are facemasks that brainwash basic creatures,
        a floating platform he travels on everywhere, a jetpack that also can fight on its own and he transformed two
        seperate castles on seperate occasions into giant battle machines. The castles were also done in just hours. More info on what he has accomplished
        can be found in the Goal&Motive section.
