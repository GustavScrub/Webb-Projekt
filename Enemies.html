            Fawfuls enemies don't really need to be explained. He is in Mario games, the villains enemies are the Mario brothers. However something
            pretty interesting is that Bowser is also his enemy. This is because Fawful is threatening all of the mushroom kingdom and refuses to ally
            with Bowser. Bowser has the brains to figure out that with Fawful around, his castle will also be destroyed and therefore helps the mario brothers.
